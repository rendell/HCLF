-   The mental resilience assessment results suggest statistically significant results following the intervention. An increase of 2.3% is noted in the resilience of the test group following the intervention. While the results remain static for the control group that did not partake in the intervention program.

# Plot gender results

-   Interestingly, upon dis aggregation of the results, it becomes apparent that there are marked difference between the results for female students versus male students.
-   It is particularly striking that the female average is constant and is below the level of what the resilience scale methodology considers "Normal resilience".

| Group | Gender | Average | Interpretation    | Percentage change |
|:------|:-------|:-------:|-------------------|:-----------------:|
| Pre   | Male   |  3.35   | Normal resilience |                   |
| Pre   | Female |  2.92   | Low resilience    |                   |
| Post  | Male   |  3.39   | Normal resilience |       1.1%        |
| Post  | Female |  2.92   | Low resilience    |       0.0%        |

# Methodology

-   The calculations benefited from a survey conducted between X and X.

-   Surveys were distributed to X schools in both Papiamento and English.

-   Necessary precautions were taken to ensure the anonymity of respondents.

-   A baseline assessment was conducted prior to intervention as well as following the intervention program.

-   The method of difference-in-difference was utilized to evaluate the impact of intervention.
