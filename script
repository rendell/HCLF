# Introduction

Heart Centered Leadership foundation (HCLF) in 2021 initiated the 'Curason pa Curason' program aiming to bolster mental resilience of youth and young adults by engaging the target group at schools and normalizing conversations around the topic.

Using an experiment in San Nicolas, Aruba, this note shows that providing targeted training programs have a measurable impact on the children resiliency scores, but only when XX.

The impacts on the resiliency scores are marginally positive, and appear to be cost-effective.

## Context

The RCT took place in San Nicolas at X schools. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the average income of households is San Nicolas is XX percent lower than the national average, indicative of inadequate job creation and lower social- economic prospects.

Home to significant Venezuelan migrant population.

Educational intervention is well suited to impact evaluation.

Intervention was applied at school.

Carefully designed for rigerous impact evaluation: phased in with randomized control trial (RCT).

Randomization means that we can easily compare outcomes between groups and interpret difference as impact.

-   Compared the outcome in schools in San Nicolas with the program to schools without the program.

## Intervention

Between Sept 2021 and October 2021, XX children between the ages of X to X of our study sample were assigned to two intervention groups or to a control group.The design of the experiment is further outlined in the final chapter titled 'Evaluation design'.

The intervention group received a training on . The training was organized and facilitated by HCLF. It aimed at

The training covered X areas . Each module included a series of videos, exercises, and guided discussions.

-   The mental resilience assessment results suggest statistically significant results following the intervention. An increase of 2.3% is noted in the resilience of the test group following the intervention. While the results remain static for the control group that did not partake in the intervention program.

## Plot gender results

-   Interestingly, upon dis aggregation of the results, it becomes apparent that there are marked difference between the results for female students versus male students.
-   It is particularly striking that the female average is constant and is below the level of what the resilience scale methodology considers "Normal resilience".

| Group | Gender | Average | Interpretation    | Percentage change |
|:------|:-------|:-------:|-------------------|:-----------------:|
| Pre   | Male   |  3.35   | Normal resilience |                   |
