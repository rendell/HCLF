# Matrix questions (based on 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree)
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself 
At times I think I am no good at all
I feel that I have a number of good 
I am able to do things as well as most other people 
I feel I do not have much to be proud of 
I certainly feel useless at times 
I feel that I'm a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others 
I wish I could have more respect for myself 
All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure 
I take a positive attitude toward myself
